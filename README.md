# O.D.I.N
=========
Orgainzed Digital Intelligent Network (O.D.I.N)

O.D.I.N is a framework for building "Origanized Digital Intelligent Networks", it use Tensorflow or Theano to create and manage computational graph.

Its end-to-end design aims for a versatile input-to-output frametwork, that minimized the burden of repeative work in machine learning pipeline, and allows researchers to conduct experiments in a fasters and more flexible way.
